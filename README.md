# Whale-Recognition-Deep-Learning-Model
Like facial recognition but for whales. All whale tails are unique : )

Trained a Deep Learning model to recognize individual whales by their tails.

This solution saves marine biology researchers countless time and money not having to compare thousands of individual whale tail images by hand.

Check out the jupyter notebook for all the details.

Paper with code included.
